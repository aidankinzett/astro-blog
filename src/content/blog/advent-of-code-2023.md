This year I am doing the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) in TypeScript. This is the first year that I am aiming to complete all days.

I set up my repo using [AoC Runner](https://github.com/caderek/aocrunner) from @caderek. The runner will create templated files for you, run the TypeScript compilation in watch mode and will also take care of loading the puzzle inputs and submitting the results.

You can follow along with my progress [on GitHub](https://github.com/aidankinzett/aoc2023).
